Fake Job Detection Using Machine Learning
📖 Description

A short overview of your project:

This project aims to detect fake job postings using machine learning techniques. It analyzes job descriptions and other metadata to identify fraudulent listings, helping users avoid scams in online job markets.

🚀 Features

Predicts whether a job posting is fake or real

Uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) for text analysis

User-friendly web interface (Flask/Streamlit)

Trained on a labeled dataset of job postings

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow

Pandas, NumPy

Flask / Streamlit

HTML, CSS (for frontend)

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Step-by-step instructions to run the project locally:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-job-detection.git

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd fake-job-detection

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the app
python app.py


If you’re using Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py

📊 Dataset

You can mention your dataset:

The dataset used for training and testing is from Kaggle Fake Job Posting Dataset
.

🧠 Model Training

Briefly describe your ML model:

The text data is vectorized using TF-IDF and trained using a Logistic Regression classifier. The model achieves around 96% accuracy on the test set.

💻 Usage

Explain how users can interact with your app:

Enter a job description in the input box and click Predict. The app will output whether the job posting is Real or Fake.
